# MAX-REST_API

A basic starter to use the maxurl object to access web (REST) API's.

Some sources to get you started:

In the CMD Techlab session we will also look into using the shell object in Max to let our comp. speak aloud using shell commands. You can find that object that here. Tested on MacOS Catalina. Not sure Windows will speak stuff:

To get our API data do something in the physical world we can trigger stuff on a Arduino. 
In this rep you'll find a simple arduino sketch to parse ints we send from Max.
See the file Serialread_fromMax.ino.


For non Max... javascript based web API stuff i highly recommend:
Daniel Shiffman // The Coding Train. // Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript --- https://youtu.be/DbcLg8nRWEg
 
Next to the API stuff we can do we should take a look at the mqtt protocol for getting data to and from web services.
When using Max we should get either this object:
openData MQTT an overview:

MQTT with Max

Or we can do MQTT with Node.js in (or outside) Max with:
